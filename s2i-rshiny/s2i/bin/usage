This is the rshiny-rocker S2I image:
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Sample invocation:

s2i build <source code path/URL> rshiny-rocker <application image>

The source code path should have minimally the following structure:

```
application/
PACKAGES
```

Where PACKAGES is a newline separated list, in utf-8, of arguments to
`install2.r -e` command.

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run <application image>
